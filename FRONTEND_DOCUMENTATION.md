## Website Overview

### General Purpose and Scope

The AI Interviewer Agent is a sophisticated web application designed to provide interactive mock interview practice sessions powered by artificial intelligence. The website enables users to configure personalized interview scenarios, participate in voice-first interviews with AI agents, and receive detailed coaching feedback to improve their interview skills.

### High-Level User Flow

1. **Landing & Configuration**: Users arrive at a visually striking landing page with hero section and immediately access interview configuration options
2. **Setup**: Users specify job role, difficulty, style, and optionally upload resume content
3. **Interview Session**: Users engage in a voice-first interview experience with real-time AI interaction
4. **Feedback & Results**: Users receive comprehensive coaching feedback, performance analysis, and learning resources
5. **Authentication (Optional)**: Users can create accounts to save progress and access historical data

The typical interaction progresses from configuration → interview → feedback, with the application supporting both anonymous sessions and authenticated user accounts for enhanced features.

## Navigation & Routing Map

### Route Structure

The application uses a simple routing structure focused on the single-page application pattern:

```
/ (Root Route)
├── Dynamic State Rendering
│   ├── Configuring State (Landing + Setup)
│   ├── Interviewing State (Voice Interface)
│   ├── Post-Interview State (Results)
│   └── Completed State (Final Summary)
└── /* (Catch-all Route)
    └── 404 Not Found Page
```

### Navigation Flow Diagram

```
Landing Page (Configuring State)
    ↓ "Start Interview" Button
Interview Session (Interviewing State)
    ↓ "End Interview" or Natural Completion
Results Processing (Post-Interview State)
    ↓ Automatic Transition After Processing
Final Summary (Completed State)
    ↓ "New Interview" Button
Landing Page (Reset to Configuring State)
```

### State-Based Navigation

Rather than traditional page-to-page navigation, the application uses state-based routing within the single page:

1. **Entry Point**: All users arrive at `/` (configuring state)
2. **State Progression**: States change based on user actions and system events
3. **Reset Functionality**: Users can return to initial state via "New Interview" or header reset
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid routes redirect to 404 page with return-to-home option

### Modal Navigation

Authentication flows occur through modal overlays that don't change the route:

- Sign In/Sign Up modals overlay current content
- Modal state managed through component state, not routing
- Successful authentication persists user to current application state

### Header Navigation

The header provides contextual navigation based on application state:

- **Configuring State**: Full header with branding and auth controls
- **Interviewing State**: Header hidden for immersive experience
- **Results States**: Header visible with "New Interview" option
- **Brand Click**: Returns to top of page (scrolls to hero section)

## Limitations or UX Issues

### Identified UX Challenges

#### Navigation and Orientation

**Limited Breadcrumb Navigation**: Users cannot easily see their current position in the interview process or jump to specific sections without completing the flow.

**No Session Recovery**: If users accidentally refresh the page during an interview, they lose their progress and must start over (unless authenticated).

**State Transition Clarity**: The transition from interview to results processing lacks clear progress indicators, potentially causing user confusion during longer processing times.

#### Voice Interface Constraints

**Microphone Permission Dependency**: The core functionality relies on browser microphone access, which may be blocked or unavailable in some environments.

**Speech Recognition Accuracy**: The interface doesn't provide obvious ways to correct misunderstood speech without manual transcript editing.

**Audio Feedback Loop**: No clear prevention of audio feedback if users have speakers active during voice interaction.

#### Mobile Experience Gaps

**Voice Interface on Mobile**: Mobile browsers have varying support for speech recognition APIs, potentially creating inconsistent experiences.

**Touch Interaction Backup**: Limited fallback options for users who prefer or need touch-based interaction over voice commands.

#### Content and Accessibility

**Visual-Only Feedback**: Important interface state changes rely heavily on visual cues without adequate screen reader support indicators.

**Color-Dependent Information**: Some interface states use color as the primary means of conveying information (green for success, red for errors).

**Text Size Flexibility**: No user controls for adjusting text size or contrast beyond browser defaults.

#### Performance and Technical

**Resource Intensive Animations**: Heavy use of animations and effects may impact performance on lower-end devices.

**Background Process Clarity**: Users have limited visibility into what's happening during AI processing, coaching analysis, and resource curation.

#### User Account and Data

**Anonymous Session Limitations**: Anonymous users lose access to their session data and cannot retrieve feedback after closing the browser.

**Limited Session Management**: No ability to pause and resume interviews, or save partial progress within a session.

#### Error Handling

**Network Dependency**: Heavy reliance on network connectivity with limited offline functionality or graceful degradation.

**Error Recovery**: Some error states require users to restart the entire process rather than recovering from the point of failure.

### Potential Improvements

While these limitations exist, the current implementation prioritizes the core voice-first interview experience and provides a solid foundation for iterative improvements in accessibility, mobile optimization, and user control features.
