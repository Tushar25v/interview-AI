        Based on the interview, I've identified significant gaps in algorithm knowledge. Let me find resources.

        Found 1 free learning resources for 'algorithm fundamentals':

        1. **Algorithm Design Manual**
           Type: tutorial
           URL: https://www.algorithm-archive.org/
           Description: Free comprehensive guide to algorithm design and analysis.
