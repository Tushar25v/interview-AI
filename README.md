## ✨ Core Features

This platform is more than just a Q&A bot. It's a comprehensive interview preparation ecosystem.

### 1. Dynamic AI Interviewer Agent

- **Adaptive Questioning**: The AI interviewer doesn't just follow a script. It generates relevant questions based on the job role, job description, and the content of your resume. It also asks insightful follow-up questions based on your answers.
- **Multiple Interview Styles**: You can choose from various interview styles (`Formal`, `Casual`, `Technical`, `Aggressive`) to simulate different real-world scenarios.
- **Configurable Difficulty**: Adjust the interview's difficulty (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`) to match your preparation level.
- **Time-Aware Sessions**: Practice under pressure with timed interviews, forcing you to give concise and effective answers.

### 2. Real-time Agentic Coach

- **Turn-by-Turn Feedback**: As you answer each question, a silent "Coach Agent" analyzes your response in the background. It provides immediate, private feedback on your clarity, confidence, and the substance of your answer.
- **In-depth Performance Metrics**: The coach tracks various aspects of your performance throughout the session.

### 3. Personalized Learning Engine

- **Intelligent Resource Recommendations**: After the interview, the system identifies your key areas for improvement.
- **Curated Learning Materials**: Based on this analysis, the Coach Agent performs a targeted web search to find and recommend high-quality articles, guides, and videos to help you strengthen your weak spots. Each recommendation comes with a justification for why it's relevant to you.

### 4. Advanced Speech & Voice Integration

- **High-Fidelity STT/TTS**: Experience seamless, natural-sounding conversations thanks to advanced Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services.
- **Voice Selection**: Choose the voice for your AI interviewer to personalize the experience.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is built on a modern, decoupled architecture, with a React frontend and a Python backend. The core of the application is a multi-agent system orchestrated by a central session manager.

- **Frontend**: A [Vite](httpss://vitejs.dev/)-powered [React](httpss://reactjs.org/) application using [TypeScript](httpss://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the [Shadcn/UI](httpss://ui.shadcn.com/) component library. It communicates with the backend via a RESTful API.
- **Backend**: A [FastAPI](httpss://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application that serves the API. Its key components are:

  - **`AgentSessionManager` (Orchestrator)**: The central coordinator. It manages the lifecycle of an interview session, routes messages between the user and the agents, and maintains the state.
  - **`InterviewerAgent`**: Responsible for conducting the interview. It generates questions, decides the next action (e.g., ask a question, follow up, conclude), and adapts its behavior based on the session configuration.
  - **`AgenticCoachAgent`**: The "silent partner." It evaluates user responses, provides turn-by-turn feedback, generates the final comprehensive summary, and finds relevant learning resources.
  - **Services**: A collection of services for interacting with external systems, including the LLM (`LLMService`), web search (`SearchService`), and database persistence (`ThreadSafeSessionRegistry`).
- **Database**: [Supabase](httpss://supabase.io/) (PostgreSQL) is used for user authentication and for storing session data, including conversation history and feedback.
- **LLM**: The AI's intelligence is powered by Google's **Gemini** models.

## ☁️ Deployment

### Backend on Microsoft Azure (App Service)

The backend is designed to be containerized with Docker and deployed as a Web App on Azure.

#### Step 1: Create Azure Resource Group

- A resource group is a container for your Azure resources.

1. Login to the [Azure Portal](httpss://portal.azure.com/).
2. Go to **Resource groups** > **+ Create**.
3. Set a name (e.g., `ai-interviewer-rg`) and region.
4. Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.

#### Step 2: Create Azure Container Registry (ACR)

- ACR stores your private Docker container images.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Container Registry** and click **Create**.
2. Configure it:
   - **Resource group**: Select the one you just created.
   - **Registry name**: A globally unique name (e.g., `ai-interviewer-registry`).
   - **SKU**: **Basic** is a good starting point.
3. Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.
4. Once created, go to **Access keys** in your ACR resource and **Enable Admin user**. Note the username and password.

#### Step 3: Build and Push Docker Image to ACR

1. **Login to your ACR instance** from your local machine:
   ```bash
   docker login your-registry-name.azurecr.io
   # Use the admin username and password from the previous step.
   ```
2. **Build the Docker image** from the root of the project:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-registry-name.azurecr.io/ai-interviewer-backend:latest .
   ```
3. **Push the image to ACR:**
   ```bash
   docker push your-registry-name.azurecr.io/ai-interviewer-backend:latest
   ```

#### Step 4: Create Azure App Service Plan

- This defines the compute resources for your app.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **App Service Plan** and click **Create**.
2. Configure it:
   - **Resource group**: Use the same one.
   - **Name**: e.g., `ai-interviewer-plan`.
   - **Operating System**: **Linux**.
   - **Pricing tier**: Choose a suitable tier (e.g., `B1` or `P1V2`).

#### Step 5: Create Azure Web App (App Service)

- This is the service that will run your Docker container.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Web App** and click **Create**.
2. **Basics Tab**:
   - **Resource group**: Use the same one.
   - **Name**: A unique name for your app (e.g., `ai-interviewer-api`). This will be part of your URL.
   - **Publish**: **Docker Container**.
   - **Operating System**: **Linux**.
   - **App Service Plan**: Select the plan you created.
3. **Docker Tab**:
   - **Image Source**: **Azure Container Registry**.
   - **Registry**: Select your ACR instance.
   - **Image**: Select your `ai-interviewer-backend` image.
   - **Tag**: `latest`.
4. **Configuration**:
   - After creation, go to your App Service resource.
   - In **Settings > Configuration > Application settings**, add all the environment variables from your `.env` file (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, etc.).
   - **Crucially, add a `WEBSITES_PORT` setting with the value `8000`** to tell Azure which port your FastAPI app is running on inside the container.
5. Click **Save**. Azure will pull the image and start your application. Your backend will be available at `httpss://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net`.

### Frontend on Vercel

The frontend can be easily deployed with Vercel.

1. **Push your code to a Git repository** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. **Sign up or log in to [Vercel](httpss://vercel.com/)** with your Git provider account.
3. **Create a New Project** and import your repository.
4. **Configure the project**:
   - Vercel should automatically detect that you are using Vite.
   - **Set the Root Directory** to `frontend`.
   - **Add Environment Variables**: In the project settings, add your frontend environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). Use your deployed Azure backend URL for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and deploy your site.

The `vercel.json` file in the root directory ensures that Vercel correctly handles routing for the single-page application.
